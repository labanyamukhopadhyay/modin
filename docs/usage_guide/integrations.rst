Third Party Library Integrations
================================

Our goal is that Modin is a drop-in replacement for Pandas â€” i.e., it won't break your workflow when you try to use Modin 
with a third-party library that works with Pandas. In the table we have tested select APIs from several libraries and taken note of each one's success metric
(the number of successful test calls / total test calls) and compared the overall interoperability between Pandas and Modin. 

In the deeper dive, you can view the Jupyter notebook we have used to test API calls and the corresponding Github issues filed. If you come across other issues/ examples 
in your own workflows we encourage you to file an `issue <https://github.com/modin-project/modin/issues/new/choose>`_ or contribute a `PR <https://github.com/modin-project/modin/pulls>`_!


.. note::
    These interoperability metrics are preliminary and not all APIs for each library have been tested.

     - **Pandas**: Accepts Pandas DataFrames as inputs for producing plots, including specifying X and Y parameters as df columns |br|
       **Modin**: Mostly accepts Modin DataFrames as inputs for producing plots (the exception is choropleth), but fails when specifying X and Y parameters as df columns
